# PRD: Smoke Test Fixes

## Background

After completing Organ Unification Phase 1-3, smoke testing revealed configuration issues:
1. N8N port wrong in system/panorama routes (5678 should be 5679)
2. Quality state.json missing
3. Brain focus/summary endpoint has UUID type error

## 功能描述

1. Fix N8N port configuration in system routes and panorama routes
2. Initialize Quality state.json file
3. Make system routes resilient to partial Brain failures
4. Create automated verification script

## 成功标准

- [ ] `/api/system/status` returns all services as "ok"
- [ ] `/api/panorama/full` shows all services as "up"
- [ ] Verification script runs successfully
